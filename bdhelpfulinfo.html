          <h4>Discord missing in installer / BD settings missing after install</h4>
          The user should reinstall Discord just by installing it again. If this doesn't work, they should be prompted
          to
          <i>fully</i> reinstall Discord.<br />

            target="_blank">MacOS guide</a><br />
          For BD settings missing, make sure the user actually installs BD again after reinstalling Discord.<br /><br />
          <u>Linux users:</u><br />
          BD not appearing in the installer usually means that the user has not installed Discord the normal way via
          discord.com<br />
          The user should use <a href="https://gist.github.com/ObserverOfTime/d7e60eb9aa7fe837545c8cb77cf31172"
            target="_blank">BetterDiscordCTL</a>, as this supports Appstore/Flatpak/Snap/whatever installs.<br />

            reinstall of Discord</a>, as their client is probably corrupted in some way and is forcing updates on every

          PTB/Canary - explain to the user that they should either move to Stable, or deal with it. These clients
          receive
          updates much more often than Stable and as such the issue will be more prevalent.<br />
          A solution to this is apparently in the works for BD, but nothing yet.<br /><br />

          <h4>User's installed addons not showing in addon tabs</h4>
          There are a couple possible causes for this:
          <ul>
            <li>File shows as "download.html". The user has a download manager, and it is downloading the wrong file.
              Prompt the user to disable/remove
              their download manager for the file to download correctly.</li>
            <li>The filename looks almost correct, such as "ZeresPluginLibrary plugin.js". Instruct the user to add the
              missing "." between the addon's name and the "plugin"/"theme" in the filename.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>Addons giving errors immediately upon loading them</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>"META not found". Ask the user to either screenshot the contents of the file, or send the file. Check
              that
              the file actually contains the appropriate code for the addon. Redownloading the file should fix it, but
              you
              can also direct the user to copy-paste the proper code into the file in case redownloading doesn't work.
            </li>
            <li>Most other errors should be reported directly to the developer of the addon, you can either link their
              GitHub issues or direct the user to the author's support server if they have one.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>BD logo flashing in bottom corner of games (PTB/Canary)</h4>
          Prompt user to disable in-game overlay, or enable legacy overlay.<br />
          This should be fixed in the next update of BD.
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>Window snapping broken with BD</h4>
          Caused by transparency and is a known bug with Electron. Not a BD issue to fix.

          <h4>Plugins breaking after a Discord/BD update</h4>
          There is nothing we can do specifically to help the user, unless the issue is crashing or causing the user to
          not be able to disable their plugin(s).<br />
          If the user is experiencing crashing immediately after starting Discord as a result of a Discord/BD update,
          instruct them to do a Repair with the BD installer.<br />
          If the user knows what plugin is causing their issue, they should report it directly to the developer.<br />
          If the user <i>does not</i> know which plugin is causing their issue, we cannot help them much other than
          instruct them to do a binary search of their plugins folder to find the cause.<br />Then once they find the
          affected plugin(s), they can report the issue to the dev(s).
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>General issues with plugins</h4>
          Again, we cannot help the user much if they know which plugin is causing the issue.<br />
          It may be possible to accurately identify what type of plugin could be causing it, i.e. an issue with the
          members tab could be caused by a plugin that interacts with it, such as MemberCount.<br />
          Knowledge like this could help the user find the afflicted plugin.
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>Plugins folder location</h4>
          Some issues may cause the user to not be able to access their settings to open the plugins folder, so you can

          <h4>Theme breaks to the point of making it impossible to disable it</h4>
          Doing a repair with the installer will disable all addons, so the user can remove the broken theme.<br />
          Alternatively, you can instruct them to use this snippet:<br />
          <code class="codeblock">
            BdApi.Themes.getAll().forEach((theme) => BdApi.Themes.disable(theme));
            document.getElementById("customcss").innerHTML = "";

                document.getElementById("customcss").innerHTML = "";
              </code>
            </pre>
          </figure>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>Theme has broken elements, or is broken in general</h4>
          The user should report this directly to the dev of the theme(s), if not done so already.<br />
          If there is a solution available that the dev has not merged, feel free to offer it to the user.
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>Themes folder location</h4>
          Some issues may cause the user to not be able to access their settings to open the themes folder, so you can
          instruct them to open it manually.
          <ul>
            <li>Windows<ul>
                <li>Press <code>Win</code> + <code>R</code> and paste in <code>%appdata%/betterdiscord/themes</code>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>MacOS<ul>
                <li>Go to Finder, press <code>Cmd</code> + <code>Shift</code> + <code>G</code> and paste in
                  <code>~/Library/Application Support/betterdiscord/themes</code>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Linux<ul>
                <li>Open terminal and paste in <code>cd ~/.config/BetterDiscord/themes</code>, then
                  <code>xdg-open .</code>
                </li>
              </ul>
          </ul>
          It may be necessary to guide the user to the custom.css file in some cases, here are the paths to that:
          <ul>
            <li>Windows: <code>%appdata%/betterdiscord/data/stable/custom.css</code></li>
            <li>MacOS: <code>~/Library/Application Support/betterdiscord/data/stable/custom.css</code></li>
            <li>Windows: <code>~/.config/BetterDiscord/data/stable/custom.css</code></li>
          </ul>
          These paths assume the user is on the Stable client, so if they are on PTB/Canary they should replace "stable"
          in those paths with their respective client name.

          Users can utilise this when snippets they use have stopped working.<br />
          Doesn't work well on themes that import most of their codebase, the user would be better off waiting for the
          theme's dev to update the theme.
