        <h1> Sick of feeling like the world hates me </h1>
        <p>I'm feeling sick of leaving the house only to be met with looks of disgust and disdain. It feels like
            everyone I pass on the street knows something bad about me but I have no clue whatsoever what I even did.
        </p>

        <p>I don't want to leave the house for anything unless I have to (for work or such). I can't be bothered trying
            to make new friendships/relationships because I feel like absolutely everyone around my age, knows
            everything about me. I don't know what I could have possibly done that could have been spread around in such
            a way that it never came back to me.</p>

        <p>I'm already feeling so lost in life, I have zero aspirations and while I hate my current job, I have no other
            options available. These feelings are just making living so horrible.<br>
            I have some money saved up that I might just spend on a nice pc upgrade, so that I don't really have any
            reason to leave the house and can just stay inside, enjoying my own company.</p>

        <p>I don't want to kill myself because of how selfish it is, but the thoughts plague my mind so much that I feel
            like it's my only option.<br>
            At least if I do, I could sell my stuff where optimally the money would go to a cat shelter.<br>
            I don't see myself living past 30 so I guess I can start saving and planning on the best way to go.</p>

        <p>The void calls and I hear it loudly.</p>
